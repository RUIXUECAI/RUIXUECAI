  <div class="hi">  Hi, </div>
    <div class="name">Are you enjoying your trip? Nice to meet you. This is Ruixue Cai. I’m a Chinese graphic designer studying at Virginia Commonwealth University. In my studying process, I aim to make things interactive and shareable about feelings. I designed these pages to make you feel like we are traveling through different planets. Have you noticed? On the home page, only you (the cursor) and I (the name) have colors because I want you to find colors in my world. It reflects my creation process, that life is usually dull and pale, but I could light it up with my artworks. My works combined my personal experiences with the fresh new inspirations from my life. I created this world to travel with you and to show you some ideas and works I’ve made.
Let’s Go and see some of my other works by taking the little rocket, and They won’t disappoint you!
